# 🌐 DataNest: MongoDB & Node.js Project
Welcome to DataNest, my first go-to project using the integration of MongoDB and Node.js! This will be a simple API-REST app in which I will create a MongoDB database, create a server with NodeJS, use a RESTful client and use a MVC model🚀 This repository demonstrates how to build a robust backend application using modern JavaScript technologies. Whether you're a beginner like me or an experienced developer, this project is designed to help you understand the fundamentals and advanced concepts of working with databases and backend development.

## ⚙️ Installation

- Follow these steps to get started with DataNest on your local machine:
- Clone the repository:
  
                        git clone https://github.com/Ornella-Gigante/DataNest_MongoDB_NodeJS.git
                        cd DataNest_MongoDB_NodeJS
  
- Install dependencies:

                        npm install
  
- Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

                        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
                        PORT=3000
  
- Run the application:

                        npm start
  
- Open your browser or API client (like Postman) and navigate to:

                        http://localhost:3000

  
## 🚀 Usage

- This project provides a RESTful API that allows you to perform CRUD operations on your data. Below are some example endpoints:
📌 Endpoints:
1️⃣ Get all items
GET /api/items
2️⃣ Get a single item by ID
GET /api/items/:id
3️⃣ Create a new item
POST /api/items
                        
                        Body (JSON):
                        json
                        {
                          "name": "Sample Item",
                          "description": "A brief description of the item"
                        }
4️⃣ Update an item

- PUT /api/items/:id

                        Body (JSON):
                        json
                        {
                          "name": "Updated Item Name"
                        }
5️⃣ Delete an item

- DELETE /api/items/:id

## 🏁 How to Start the App

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:
1️⃣ Start MongoDB
Open a terminal and run the following command to start the MongoDB server:

                        mongod
Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on its default port (27017).
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and install all required dependencies:
                        
                        npm install
3️⃣ Start the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, start the server using:

                        npm start
This will run the app using nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when changes are detected.
4️⃣ Access the API
The server will be running on:

                        http://localhost:3700
You can now test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
