# DataNest_MongoDB_NodeJS
This is my first project using NodeJS and MongoBD as persistence. This will be a simple API-REST app in which I will create a MongoDB database, create a server with NodeJS, use a RESTful client and use a MVC model.

## How to Start the App

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. Start MongoDB
Open a terminal and run the following command to start the MongoDB server:
        bash
        mongod

2. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on its default port (27017).
Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and install all required dependencies:
        bash
        npm install

3. Start the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, start the server using:
        bash
        npm start

This will run the app using nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when changes are detected.

4. Access the API
The server will be running on http://localhost:3700. You can now test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
